Given a Binary Tree. Check for the Sum Tree for every node except the leaf node. Return true if it is a Sum Tree otherwise, return false.

A SumTree is a Binary Tree where the value of a node is equal to the sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree. An empty tree is also a Sum Tree as the sum of an empty tree can be considered to be 0. A leaf node is also considered a Sum Tree.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the Tree)

Constraints:
2 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ node value ≤ 10^5

__Intuition ->Use recursion to find the sum of left and right subtree. If this value is equal to root's value , return the sum of root's value and the sum of left and right subtree.If not, return 0.__

```C++
nt fun(Node* root){
        if(root==NULL) return 0;
        if(root->left==NULL && root->right==NULL) return root->data;
        
        int leftC = fun(root->left);
        int rightC = fun(root->right);
        
        if(root->data == leftC+rightC){
            return root->data+leftC+rightC;
        }else return 0;
    }
    bool isSumTree(Node* root) {
        return fun(root);
    }
```
